#!/bin/sh
#
# Example: Using set's x flag; the command logger
#
# USE:
#   ./set_x.sh
#
# NOTES:
#   Command logging can be turned on with 'set -x' and off with 'set +x'
#
#   A shebang like '#!/bin/sh -ex' turns on command logging for the entire file,
#   unless explicitly disabled somewhere in the script. Setting the flag in this
#   script does not turn on command logging in the script we call - that is a
#   different sub-shell.
#
#   You could use a DEBUG environment variable to enable command logging like this:
#      [ -n "${DEBUG}" ] && set -x
#   That could be useful while comparing script operation with and without command
#   logging, especially if several scripts are involved.
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   see show_help()
#
# EXIT CODES:
#   None - purely demonstrational
#
# CAVEATS:
#   Shebang omits -e, we are manually checking for errors
